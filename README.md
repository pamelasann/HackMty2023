# TRUST: investment coach

A prototype of a mobile application was made, which based on user information of the Banorte bank displays the income and expenses that have been registered up to that moment, connecting to a real time data base to simulate the structure of the bank's users. The app displays recommendations for possible investments options which are consider suitable for the profile of the user. It also includes the prototype of a chatbot integrated with artificial intelligence that answers questions about investments.

The application was designed to be implemented in the existing Banorte mobile application therefore the first screen starts with the user's data as seen below.
